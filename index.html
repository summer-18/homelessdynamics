        <hr>
        <p>Our generation is very focused on what they can do for themselves. We have become protected by our own little bubbles. Millenials are not very aware of the things around them. This websiteâ€™s purpose is to bring emphasis to homelessness to not only teens but to everyone's attention. 7,144 people in 2018 were reported homeless in  Maryland.  This demonstrates how homelessness has affected many people not only in Maryland but all around the U.S. Often times, people wish to help but have no knowledge on how to help. With our website, anyone can access information to see what places are around them where they can volunteer, donate, and make a change in their community today! </p>
